**Repo Finder** is a Kotlin written **Android App** that utilises **GitHub APIs** to allow user to search for a repository by name.
The search result is displayed in a list of repositories with matching names based on keywords submitted, as shown below.

**Repo Finder** uses some of the **Jetpack** libraries to observe the variables driven by **LiveData**, **Picasso** to bind images, **Coroutines** to launch the viewModelScope and **Retrofit** for networking.
